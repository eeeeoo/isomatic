          <p>
              Music has been known to have an emotional and physiological effect. However, we usually only focus on the way the song makes us feel as we walk down the street – never paying attention to the way the our body is adapting in conjunction.  Realizing this, we wanted to use music to establish a more concrete connection between the senses and ones body. We are constantly reacting to things but instead of looking at mood changes, we wanted to narrow our focus to the physical reactions we often ignore.  Furthermore, we were aware that the wearable market has been saturated with heartbeat technology and limited in aesthetics, that we wanted to shift away from reliance on heartbeat and screen technologies.

            The intersection of soma, the body, and aesthetics, sensory appreciations triggers discussion about the meaning of our bodily experience and human intersubjectivity. We not only wanted to emphasize how our body becomes the source of aesthetic qualities for design, but also explore ways to increase our body awareness so we can “become more perceptive and aware in the physical world in which we live and act” [2]. Wearable technology has the potential to shape the way we perceive our personal narratives and through the evaluation of the body, we wanted to contemplate on ways to document phenomenological data. Furthermore, by giving emphasis to the body, the body’s biodata triggers the music to change rather than your mood changing the music.

            <p>
              We found the semantics of hot and cold evocative in. our work. The words have a lexical relationship, acting as gradable pairs with no absolute scale. Hot and cold is used in many contexts including weather, physical sensations, emotional states, food, and even Marshall McLuhan’s media theory. We found the terms to be a parallel to how our body temperature works with music. Heat can be intimate and skin-close, while coolness can be less invasive than heat, but rather welcoming somatic response and triggering interrogations about our bodily experience.

              iSomatic is a wearable intended to bring more awareness to our bodily state while using music as a representation as well as a form to manipulate these different states. We gather bodily data through wearable technology in which we aim to make the wearables as fashionable, non-intrusive, and modular as possible. The bodily data is then translated to the music selection to enhance the wearers experience with their body and their biofeedback activity at hand. We designed the wearable to display led lights providing a visual representation of the temperature for social activities as well as for aesthetic. iSomatic not only allows for an exploration of body data leaving the control to the body, but also allows the user to get conscious control again by adjusting whether they’d like to “warm” or “cool” music. iSomatic has versatile use as it can be used for people who want to explore their physiology or try to affect it.

              <p>The aesthetic of the wearable is significant to this project because the self expression regarding wearable technology has been limited to jewelry or accessories. While these are areas we will still be exploring, we want to focus on modularity by expanding the wearable to other body parts including sports bras, chokers, socks, or leggings. Furthermore, we would be executing music from a larger music source to allow more variety of music and expanding our categories. As we continue exploring somaesthetic wearables, we believe in discovering new ways of implementing multisensory feedback and physiological data.

              For iSomatic, the someasthetic music wearable, we had the following goals in mind:
              <ul>
                <li>Get a flexible circuit produced to make the tech non intrusive</li>
                <li>Work on an app</li>
                <li>Develop a piece of clothing that was not an armband</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="headline">Process</div>
          <h3> Flexible Circuits </h3>
            <p> We reached out to a few vendors about the possibility of creating the flexible circuits but we were soon informed of the process that involved creating the PVC (permanent virtual circuit) diagram to be able to manufacture our circuits. Because of our inexperience with extensive electrical engineering, we reached out to Bradley Munch from Olin College who was able to provide company information of their vendor as well as trusted tutorials to build this circuit. Given the short time we had, we developed only part of the circuit and did not get to have our iSomatic wearable flexible circuit manufactured.</p>
          <h4>Implementation</h4>
          <h3> App </h3>
            <p>For the app, we created a simple app that allowed a user to login with their Spotify account. From there on, they would choose their mood – hot or cold. Based on their choice, we would then direct them to the curated playlist.</p>
          <h4>Implementation</h4>
          <h3> Sports Bra </h3>
          <div class="col-sm-8">
              <img src="sportsbrasketch.JPG" style="padding:20px;width:550px;height:733px;">
          </div>
            <p>Given our last wearable was an arm band, we wanted our next wearable iteration to be a daily product that we could see in our own wardrobes. We decided to go for the sports bra design because it was close contact with the skin but also was positioned in the places for the most accurate readings of the temperature and heartbeat sensors. We wanted to keep the design of lights from the armband for the signalling of the different bodily states. </p>

          <p>
              High school athletes and active individuals might suffer from injuries when working out without trainers or coaches. Common muscle strains, stress fractures or muscle imbalances have known to hinder everyday life. Current data analysis for sports and workouts are too complicated and expensive for the average person so that it makes a trainer essential to prevent injuries. And people who can’t afford or don’t have time to visit a trainer will continue to face the possibility of injury. Inspired by the new anti-slouching devices, we thought we could use the same data and sensors to create something that allowed us to collect the angles data and record the movements of the user. We wanted to create a wearable that addressed these issues and provided a mobile trainer experience.
          </p>
          
          <div class="headline">Our Mission</div>
          <p>We decided to build on some of the technology of iSomatic and add to the wearable to have it encompass the sensors needed to monitor the workout and movement data. We chose to have the wearable address a specific activity like running to better curate the information we would need.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Use temperature and heartbeat sensors to allow the user their bodily data and for potential future use to predict potential strains </p></li>
            <li><p>Use gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine the movement of the user</p></li> 
            <li><p>Compare the data gathered with a professional trainer</p></li>                
            <li><p>Communicate with the user their potential pitfalls and enhancements for a better workout</p></li>
          </ul>
